               <p>Authorship Profiling(AP) task, which is predicting the authorship of a text
               only by extracting the linguistic and stylistic features, has a number of potential
               applications. For instance, it has been a pertinent task to the intelligence and
               security agencies that monitor author information. Moreover, author details can
               be of utmost importance in cyber forensics for identifying fake profiles, fraud
               messages and social harassment etc. For companies focused on marketing, this
               information will be definitely helpful in providing a clear understanding of the
               target audience, solely by using blogs and reviews as a source.
               </p>
               <p>
               The problem at hand is the task of classifying the authorâ€™s gender and age from his/her text and thus this task falls into the category of supervised learning. For gender identification, we have binary classification task of predicting labels as either male or female. For the age identification, we have a multi-classification task whose goal is to predict age among three classes: 15-19, 20-24, 25 and above.
