                  <p>This paper presents our solution for the Author Profiling
                  task in the FIRE challenge 2018. This task mainly focuses on finding the
                  age and gender of people from South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan,
                  Nepal, and Bangladesh from their short messaging services (SMS).
                  Since most of these people use a combination of languages such as Hindi,
                  English and Roman Urdu (i.e., multilingual text) on social media platforms
                  such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter, they also follow the
                  same practice in SMS while communicating. Thus, we aim to perform author
                  profiling by identifying gender and age of people by analyzing their
                  multilingual SMS. In this paper, we classify the gender of a person into
                  male or female categories. Moreover, we classify age into the following
                  three age groups: (i) 15-19, (ii) 20-24, and (iii) above 25. After preprocessing
                  steps including tokenization and normalization, we provide the
                  results of an experiment with several machine learning models like SVM,
                  Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. Experimental results show that Naive
                  Bayes provides competitive results when used with bilingual dictionary
                  for translation and count vectorizer for feature extraction.
